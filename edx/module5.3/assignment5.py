# TODO: Load up the dataset into a variable called X. Check the .head and
# compare it to the file you loaded in a text editor. Make sure you're
# loading your data properly--don't fail on the 1st step!
#
# .. your code here ..

#
# TODO: Copy the 'wheat_type' series slice out of X, and into a series
# called 'y'. Then drop the original 'wheat_type' column from the X
#
# .. your code here ..


# TODO: Do a quick, "nominal" conversion of 'y' by encoding it to a SINGLE
# variable (e.g. 0, 1, 2). This is covered in the Feature Representation
# reading as "Method 1)". In actuality the classification isn't nominal,
# but this is the fastest way to encode you 3 possible wheat types into a
# label that you can plot distinctly. More notes about this on the bottom
# of the assignment.
#
# .. your code here ..

#
# TODO: Basic nan munging. Fill each row's nans with the mean of the feature
#
# .. your code here ..



# 
# TODO: Use SKLearn's regular "normalize" preprocessor to normalize X's feature data
#
# .. your code here ..



#
# TODO: Project both your X_train and X_test features into PCA space.
# This has to be done because the only way to visualize the decision
# boundary in 2D, would be if your KNN algo ran in 2D as well
#
# .. your code here ..


#
# TODO: Split out your training and testing data.
# INFO: Use 0.33 test size, and use random_state=1. This is important
# so that your answers are verifiable. In the real world, you wouldn't
# specify a random_state.
#
# .. your code here ..



#
# TODO: Run KNeighborsClassifier. Start out with K=7 neighbors. NOTE:
# Be sure train your classifier against the PCA transformed feature
# data above! You do not, however, need to transform your labels.
#
# .. your code here ..


# HINT: Ensure your KNeighbors classifier object from earlier is called 'knn'.
# This method plots your TEST points against the boundary learned from your
# training data:
plotDecisionBoundary(knn, X_test, y_test)


#
# TODO: Display the accuracy score.
#
# NOTE: You don't have to run .predict before calling .score, since
# .score will take care of running your predictions for the params
# you provided.
#
# .. your code here ..


#
# BONUS: Instead of the ordinal conversion, try and get this assignment
# working with a proper Pandas get_dummies for feature encoding. HINT:
# You might have to update some of the plotDecisionBoundary code.
